# open-graph-details-scraper-API
A api(in the form of vercel serverless functions) to get og graph details for different urls.

It will be free until and unless VERCEL is free, Though free tier has a very small limit and this is not intended for intensive use. 

For me it serves it's purpose!!

Access from /api endpoint
